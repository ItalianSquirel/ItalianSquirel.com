# About Me


### [You can download my Resume Here](https://github.com/ItalianSquirel/ItalianSquirel.github.io/raw/master/downloads/Petie_Deveer_Resume_2.PDF)

My name is Petie Deveer, I am a college student studying Computer Engineering, I spend most of my free time playing video games or working on random projects. Currently, I am toying around with Linux and seeing what I can do. I’ve worked on plenty of projects some useful others not so much. I am decent with Python, Windows Command-line Tools, Node-Red amongst other useful skills like 3-D Modeling. I also consider myself proficient in OSX, Windows, and a decent amount of Linux Distros (Yeah, I get around.). I plan to attend the University of Alaska Fairbanks this upcoming Fall semester. 

Given my extensive history with debate in high school I am very good at ensuring clarity, engagement, and delivery with all that I write, yeah I might have a typo here and there but who doesn’t. This makes me very useful for writing grants, documentation, and other miscellaneous writing projects anyone might have for me.

### Some Hobbies of mine include:
*   Keyboard Building
*   Video Games
*   Making Stuff
*   Cooking
*   3-D Modeling
*   Photography
