Howdy

Recently I've been loving Linux a lot, just something about the ability to fully customize the whole operating system is so appealing, like recently I got a moving wallpaper on my desktop using a program called `Komorebi`. I absolutely love it. I still have a few things to grasp but I can see myself using Linux more in the future.

As of late I've been looking into a company called System76, they make Desktops and Laptops that mainly use Linux, PopOS specifically, and I like the concept. I was looking at their laptops but since Linus Tech Tips did a video on them recently most of System76's products are out of stock. I put a link at the bottom to their website.

I've done quite some research into RetroPi and other emulation solutions.

As for updates to the site, I added a sites page that has plenty of articles, web-tools, links to programs, etc.. I also added a downloads page for file sharing, I don't know, I might update it to be something more later.

"P.S. I was just testing the Details/Summary Pages addition."<br>
