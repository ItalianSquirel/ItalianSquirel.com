## Hello World
---

I did it! I finally got things going. I will be uploading new posts to this “website” (I’m not gonna call it a blog because that makes me sound like a boomer) just about every time I hit a stumbling block in my attempts to play with linux and just do random projects, so ill be adding to here pretty often.

I’m using a very nice Jeckyll theme (There's a link to it at the bottom) and right now the server is hosted by github, I assume that will be the case for a while but I do plan to put this through my own domain. I'm excited to see how long this will go to. 

See ya!
